# Open Documentation Academy

_Discover open source through documentation_

Canonical's Open Documentation Academy (CODA) is a collaboration between Canonical’s documentation team and documentation newcomers, experts, and those in-between, to help us all improve documentation, become better writers, and better open source contributors.

We want to lower the barrier to successful open-source software contributions, by making documentation into the gateway, and to be the model for welcoming and constructive collaboration.

## How it works

* Find a [task](https://github.com/canonical/open-documentation-academy/issues) that you're interested in _(there are many)_
* Ask to be assigned the task _(no obligations)_
* Work on the task with the help support of our mentors _(we're friendly)_
* Finish, and get recognition for your work _(expand your CV and help open source)_

## Who's it for

For **newcomers**, we provide help, advice, mentorship, and a hundred different tasks to get started on.

If you're an **expert**, we want to create a place to share knowledge, a place to get involved with new developments, and somewhere you can ask for help on your own projects. We'd also like to encourage new projects to get involved, and become sources of their own tasks on the Academy.

If you're a **project maintainer**, we warmly invite you to partner with the Academy, create your own tasks, attract contributors, get support and find a community.

## Project and community

The Open Documentation Academy is an open source project that welcomes community participation, contributions, suggestions and constructive feedback.
