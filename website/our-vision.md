# Our ambition for the Open Documentation Academy

We create opportunities for people who are new to open source by connecting them with documentation tasks on established projects. We provide assistance and mentoring on these tasks, so that members develop skills in a safe and supportive environment.

With our help, your open source journey can be a valuable experience that you can be proud of and receive tangible recognition for.
