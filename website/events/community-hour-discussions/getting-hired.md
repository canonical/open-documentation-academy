Finding a job as a technical writer can be challenging, so it's important to view it as a project. Focus on the immediate steps and remember it’s a marathon, not a sprint.

## Prerequisites for the job search

To be prepared for a job search, you must possess several skills, a positive attitude, a strong portfolio, and a history of community involvement.

### Skills

Your core skill is versatile writing in a professional setting. To improve at this, you should be aware of the documentation life cycle, its stages and stakeholders, and become familiar with common writing styles such as [American Psychological Association (APA)](https://www.apa.org/) and [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). If English isn’t your first language, consider pursuing credible language certifications. Then practice writing outside of work through blog posts, novels, or poetry.

Beyond writing, a solid grasp of information architecture systems like [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) and [Information Mapping](https://informationmapping.com/) will help you organize and present information effectively.

You also need proficiency with technology, which comes in two forms. First, adopt a _T-shaped_ approach to knowledge, starting with general knowledge and then developing a few areas of expertise. Second, understand your writing tool stack. The two main stacks are docs-as-code and the [Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture). Some coding knowledge helps, but it’s not a requirement.

Finally, soft skills are important as technical writing requires you to work with people, get your points across, and listen to others.

### Attitude

Few people know what to look for in a technical writer, so employers often focus on qualities such as excellence, leadership, initiative, and confidence. You can develop these qualities over time through volunteering and community work.

You must also have self-respect by not settling for jobs you dislike, as they will make you miserable in the long term. Take pride in your work, and remember that ultimately, you only need one job.

### Portfolio

You must have a portfolio of your work, with two to five diverse, complete samples ready. PDFs work well, but it’s better to display your tooling skills by hosting your portfolio on services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You should also be ready to discuss the choices you made in your writing samples.

Beyond creating it, your portfolio should grow with you, so treat it like a garden that you care for over time.

### Community

Community involvement is a great way to understand the industry. Start by subscribing to online channels, newsletters, and podcasts. These will help you engage with experts and other writers through comments, questions, and feedback. Over time, you can become a regular participant in forums, conferences, and meetups. And remember, you don’t need to be a community champion from day one.

## The application phase

After you’ve built your skills, attitude, portfolio, and community connections, start applying for jobs. You will face rejections, but don’t let them discourage you.

Apply only for roles where you feel you’re a good fit, and always check the formal requirements before submitting an application. Keep in mind that the feedback cycle can be slow and it may take weeks or even months to hear back, so don’t _fall in love_ with a job until you receive a formal offer.

### Written submissions

Your resume and cover letter must be tailored to the position you are applying for. Focus on the most relevant parts of your experience and emphasise outcomes and achievements rather than responsibilities.

Avoid sounding desperate for the job. Instead, explain the value you bring to the company and stay truthful. Remember that your resume is also a writing sample, so check your grammar and spelling carefully before submitting.

### Research and preparation

If your application is successful, be prepared to answer questions about any claims you make on your resume. Make sure you understand the job requirements and expectations, and take time to research the company’s business, culture, and values. For a remote interview, confirm that your computer is working properly and that your internet connection is stable. Finally, double-check the scheduled time and be punctual.

### Interviewing

Stay confident without being arrogant, and adapt to the interview style, whether panel or HR. Rephrase questions when you need clarity and ask thoughtful ones that reflect your research. Then explore what it’s like to work there, and pay close attention to vague or unclear responses.
