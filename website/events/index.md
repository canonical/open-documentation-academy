## Community Hour

**We host a [Community Hour](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/community-hour/42771) every week on a Friday, 16:00 UTC.**

Our _Community Hour_ sessions are an informal forum for discussions related to documentation.

Bring your Documentation Academy questions, share your work, or present topics you'd like to discuss. Everyone is welcome. No prior arrangements are necessary. You donâ€™t need to sign-up, or register. Just click on the link to join, for as little or as much time as you can spare, at any time during the hour.

We occasionally host for more formal presentations, and these will be recorded. The recordings archive is below.
