# How to implement a peer reviewer's feedback in your documentation

Throughout your career as a technical author, receiving feedback is one of the many things you will encounter outside of creating and reviewing other people's technical content. While it's important to be a good peer reviewer, it's also important to be able to implement good feedback in your own documentation. Doing so will help you create a more cohesive and effective documentation that is easier for users to read and follow as well as expand your perspective on the content you're writing.

## Tips for reading  a peer reviewer's feedback

Receiving reviews from other technical authors can be emotionally challenging in that the comments might make you feel like they are critiquing you as a person as opposed to the content you're writing. However, it's important to remember that these comments are not about you, but about the content you're writing and how it can be improved. Here are some tips to help you approach a peer reviewer's feedback:

* **Think critically:** There will be times that a peer reviewer will give you vague comments about the documentation you're writing, so it's important not take them at face value. Instead, ask yourself what is the peer reviewer truly trying to say about the content you're writing. For example, if the peer reviewer says "I think the first sentence is not clear," consider re-reading it out loud and think of ways it can be improved.
* **Be patient:** A peer reviewer's feedback can be hard to digest, so it's important to take your time to understand what the peer reviewer is trying to say and how to address it. If you find yourself getting overwhelmed or frustrated by a peer reviewer's feedback, step away for a few minutes and come back to it later. A break can help you to clear your mind and focus on the content you're writing.
* **Take note of patterns:** If you find yourself receiving the same feedback from multiple peer reviewers, it's important to take note of the patterns and address them in your documentation. They might indicate that a specific aspect of your documentation needs improvement.
* **View feedback as an opportunity:** As difficult as it can be to receive feedback, it's important to view it as an opportunity to improve your documentation and make it better for your users.

## Extracting useful feedback from a review

Attention to detail is a skill that a technical author should have, but when it comes to implementing feedback from a peer reviewer, it's important to be able to extract the useful information from the feedback. Here are some tips to help you extract useful feedback from a review:

* **Prioritize feedback:** Not all feedback is equal, sometimes it might be something as simple as a typo or something critical like an inaccurate step in a tutorial. Consider categorizing the feedback you receive into categories such as "critical," "important," and "minor." This will help you prioritize which feedback to address first.
* **Ask clarifying questions:** If you're unsure about a piece of feedback, ask the peer reviewer for clarification. This will help you understand the feedback better and ensure that you're addressing the correct issue.
* **Keep it is a checklist:** If you're receiving a lot of feedback, it can be helpful to keep it in a checklist format. This will help you keep track of what you've addressed and what still needs to be done. It can also be something you can use in the future when you're writing new content.

## How to update your peer reviewer after implementing feedback

While implementing feedback from a peer reviewer is important, it's also helpful to update the peer reviewer as it fosters trust and positive rapport between you and your fellow technical author. Here are some tips to help you update your peer reviewer after implementing feedback:

* **Be specific:** When updating your peer reviewer, be specific about what you've done to address their feedback. This will help them understand the changes you've made and why they were necessary.

* **Be honest yet polite:** Point out what you've done to address the feedback and why it was necessary. However, be honest yet polite about the suggestions you have rejected and why. This will help maintain a positive rapport between you and your peer reviewer.
