# What is a glossary?

A *glossary* gives the meanings of *terms* in a work or domain.
It is presented as a list of terms in alphabetic order, each with a *gloss* that explains the term.

Each explanation gives the reader enough understanding to become familiar, and perhaps even comfortable, with the term.

Simplicity is prized. A glossary entry should aim to make the reader one step more comfortable with the term.

## Structure

### Definition

A definition is a statement of fact that conveys the meaning of a term. 
A definition that consists of a simple phrase or sentence may be all the explanation that is needed. For example:

```{glossary}
core
 The working memory of a computer.
```

### Abbreviation

If the term is an abbreviation, the gloss starts with the expanded form of the term. The abbreviation is explained briefly after this expansion. For example:

```{glossary}
DNS
 **Domain Name System**. A system that translates human-readable domain names (canonical.com) to their IP addresses (185.125.190.20).
```

In a conversational style, the definition has more of the structure and tone of a spoken sentence.
For example, the definition may begin by repeating the term being defined.

```{glossary}
FC
 **Fiber Channel** is a storage networking protocol used for low-latency communication between a storage device and a node
 in a Storage Area Network (SAN).
```

In this definition of FC, the abbreviation SAN is preceded by its expansion as is customary in running text.
This is a good way to handle abbreviations that may be unfamiliar or have not yet been formally defined.

### Cross-references

Cross-references help readers navigate among related terms.

If the gloss for a term discusses a second term, the second term should be linked.

<!-- {term}`DNS` replaced by *DNS* -->
<!-- other terms: LDAP, SSL, TLS, DTLS -->


```{glossary}
DDNS
 **Domain Name System**.
 A service that automatically updates {term}`DNS` records when the underlying IP address changes (aka, dynamic IP).
```

When a concept that provides depth or broader context is used in a gloss, it can be linked using "See".

```{glossary}
DIT
 **Directory Information Tree**. In directory services (See {term}`LDAP`), a hierarchical tree-like structure used to organize and store information.
```

A collection of related topics can be provided at the end of the gloss. These could link elsewhere in the documentation, or to external resources.

```{glossary}
GnuTLS
 **GNU’s Not Unix Transport Layer Security**.
 A GNU software package that secures data in transit by implementing the
 {term}`SSL`, {term}`TLS`, and {term}`DTLS` protocols.

```

## Dictionary features

Glossary entries tend to be simpler than full dictionary entries. Some glossary entries, however, may include dictionary features such as the origin of a term, or the pronunciation, or an alternate form, or some other specialized aspect of the term that is of great interest.

## Appendix 1: Mechanics

This document is written in Markedly Structured Text
([MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/typography.html#syntax-glossaries)).

Glossaries can also be produced using [reStructured Text (rST)](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html).

A reference to a term is coded as follows:

    `{term}`referenced_term

A complex glossary entry is coded as follows ("..." indicates omitted characters):

    ```{glossary}
    GnuTLS_example
    **GNU’s Not Unix Transport Layer Security**.
    A GNU software package that secures data in transit by implementing the
    {term}`SSL`, {term}`TLS`, and {term}`DTLS` protocols.

    Related topic(s): [GnuTLS (Ubuntu Server doc...)](https://doc.../gnutls/#),
    [GnuTLS (official site)](https://www.gnutls.org/),
    Cryptography, Web services, OpenLDAP.
    ```

## Appendix 2: Locally-defined terms

These terms are referenced within the topic to illustrate cross-references.

```{glossary}
datagram
 In networking, a self-contained, independent packet sent over a network.
 A datagram can be routed from source to destination without relying on earlier or subsequent transfers.

DTLS
 **Datagram Transport Layer Security**. A protocol that provides security for {term}`datagram`-based communication, such as UDP.
 DTLS offers security features similar to TLS, but is adapted because datagram protocols are connectionless.

LDAP
 **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol**.

SSL
 **Secure Socket Layer**.

TLS
 **Transport Layer Security**.
