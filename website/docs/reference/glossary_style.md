# Glossary style

A supplement to the [Canonical Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide/en/)

## Glossary entry
A glossary entry explains what is meant by a term.

**product**   
A unit of software or hardware that is offered to a market to meet a need.

### A use of a term

A use of a term such as [product](https://www.example.com) is presented as a link to the entry for that term in a glossary.

### Good definitions

A *gloss* (the defining text) typically starts with an approachable, targeted description that is designed to help the reader understand a *sense* (a meaning) of a term.

Each gloss should be clear about what the sense includes and what it excludes. This can be done by specifying the *context* (the conditions in which the term would have that sense) and the *application* (which items are included in the sense).

### Inline definitions

The guidelines under *Good definitions* demonstrate that a term can be defined in line by presenting the term in italics and providing a brief definition in parentheses. This is useful for terms that are only used in one or a few topics. If a term is widely used, the glossary is the best place to define it.

### Ambiguity

To reduce the number of ambiguous terms, try to use appropriately-specific terms.

**core**  
The working memory of a computer.

**core file**  
A file created when an application crashes. The file reflects the state of the application at the time of the crash, including the values in working memory ([core](https://www.example.com)).

**Ubuntu Core**  
A minimal version of the Linux operating system designed to be embedded in devices that have stringent resource or performance constraints, such as [IoT](https://www.example.com) devices.

It is rare that a technical term has multiple senses, so the following example is artificial.

**cloud**  
1. A resource shared among customers and accessed via networking that contains, for example, storage and computing capacity.  
2. A mass of material suspended in a gas or liquid that scatters light.

### Structure of more-complex definitions

Although simplicity is a virtue in definitions, it helps to know how a more extensive definition can be structured.

An optional informal description may be followed by a more-formal definition and sometimes a brief explanation.
* A formal definition identifies the context and provides criteria for what is meant by the sense.
* An explanation describes one or more of: what the thing being defined is useful for, how it is structured, how it works, and the effect of using it.

### Abbreviations

An abbreviation can be expanded at the beginning of the gloss.

**DNS**  
**Domain Name System**. A system that translates human-readable domain names (canonical.com) to their IP addresses (185.125.190.20).

### References to other terms

A glossary entry or a gloss may
* refer to detailed background (using "See"),
* suggest alternative terms (using "Alternatives:"), and
* suggest related topics, including related terms (using "Related topic:" or "Related topics:" followed by a comma-delimited list of topics and terms).

Terms that are preferred in place of the current term may be presented as a link to the preferred term.

A gloss may offer advice about when to select the term (using "Compare", "Synonyms:", and "Antonyms:") or how to use the term in context (using "Usage:").

*Examples to be provided.*

### Supplementary information

Conventional language and font treatments are used to flag special properties of the gloss or of the glossary term.
* If a gloss is under construction, it may start with *Work in progress*.
* The gloss content may start with information about status of the sense, such as *Deprecated*.

Examples may be presented inline within parentheses or after the description, definition, and explanation (using "For example, ").

A citation may be presented at the end of a gloss.

*Examples to be provided.*
