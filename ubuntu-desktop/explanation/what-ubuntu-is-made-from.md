# What is Ubuntu Desktop made of?

Ubuntu Desktop has millions of users today. As a new user, you might be curious to know what Ubuntu Desktop is made of. Not necessarily a deep technical explanation, but a great overview of what it is. This is what this guide addresses. It explains what a desktop environment is, what applications are, how package managers work, and more.

## Desktop environment

The Ubuntu Desktop environment provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interacting with Ubuntu. Think of it like a theme but with more in-depth customization. Several desktop environment exists, and some are memory-intensive and others aren't.
Ubuntu Desktop ships with the GNOME desktop environment by default. Other alternative environments are:

- KDE Plasma
- XFCE
- LXQt
- MATE
- Budgie, etc.

Interestingly, Ubuntu Desktop comes in [different flavors](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/flavours), and each one has its own desktop environment. For example, the Kubuntu flavor supports the KDE Plasma desktop environment.

A desktop environment consists of different independent components that are customizable. Sometimes, a Linux user may choose to run only one component rather than the entire desktop environment to save memory. Anyway, some of these components are:

1. Windows manager: This manages a window that pops up when you open a terminal or any application at all.
2. User app: These are default application that comes within the desktop environment.
3. File manager: This is a UI environment for interacting with files.
