# Repositories

**Repositories** are the foundation for software distribution in Linux environments. They hold all the necessary files and resources needed for projects. Linux distributions like Ubuntu maintain repositories containing thousands of pre-built packages you can install on your managed computers.

Landscape lets you manage repositories on your own network using [repository mirroring](https://ubuntu.com/landscape/docs/explanation-about-repository-mirroring). Repository mirroring works by creating local copies of remote repositories, which you can further customize to provide control over the software versions available to your client machines. This feature is useful when you want to maintain packages with different versions from those in the community repositories, or distribute your own private repositories of in-house software for machines you manage.
