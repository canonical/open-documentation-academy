This document demonstrates how to "Use VirtualBox to set up port forwarding for a Multipass instance.
Multipass runs as the `root` user, so to see the instances in  VirtualBox, or through the `VBoxManage` command, you have to run those as `root`, too. To see the instances in VirtualBox, execute:

```plain
$ sudo VirtualBox
```

And, to list the instances on the command line, execute:

```plain
$ sudo VBoxManage list vms
"primary" {395d5300-557d-4640-a43a-48100b10e098}
```

[note type="information"]
You can still use the `multipass` client and the system menu icon, and any changes you make to the configuration of the instances in VirtualBox will be persistent. They may not be represented in Multipass commands such as `multipass info` , though.
