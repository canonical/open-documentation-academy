Snapcraft can be used to package and distribute Go applications in a way that
enables convenient installation by users.

The process of creating a snap for a Go application builds on standard
Go packaging tools, making it possible to adapt or integrate an
application's existing packaging into the snap building process.

## Getting started

Snaps are defined in a single `snapcraft.yaml` file placed in a
`snap` folder at the root of your project. This YAML file describes
the application, its dependencies and how it should be built.

The following example shows the entire `snapcraft.yaml` file for an existing project, [Woke](https://github.com/degville/woke-snap):

```yaml
name: woke
summary: Detect non-inclusive language in your source code
description: |
      Creating an inclusive work environment is imperative to a healthy,
      supportive, and productive culture, and an environment where everyone
      feels welcome and included. woke is a text file analysis tool that finds
      places within your source code that contain non-inclusive language and
      suggests replacing them with more inclusive alternatives.
version: git
grade: stable
base: core20

confinement: devmode

apps:
  woke:
    command: bin/woke
    plugs:
      - home
parts:
  woke:
    plugin: go
    source-type: git
    source: https://github.com/get-woke/woke
```

We'll break this file down into its components in the following sections.

### Metadata

Does this fix the review.

The `snapcraft.yaml` file starts with a small amount of
human-readable metadata, which is often already available in the project's
own packaging metadata or `README.md` file. This data is used in the
presentation of the application in the Snap Store.

```yaml
name: woke
summary: Detect non-inclusive language in your source code
description: |
      Creating an inclusive work environment is imperative to a healthy,
      supportive, and productive culture, and an environment where everyone
      feels welcome and included. woke is a text file analysis tool that finds
      places within your source code that contain non-inclusive language and
      suggests replacing them with more inclusive alternatives.
version: git
```

The `name` must be unique in the Snap Store. Valid snap names consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters and hyphens. They cannot be all numbers and they also cannot start or end with a hyphen.

By specifying `git` for the version, the current git tag or commit will be used as the version string. Versions carry no semantic meaning in snaps.

The `summary` can not exceed 79 characters. You can use a chevron '>' in the `description` key to declare a multi-line description.

### Base

The base keyword declares which :term:`base snap` to use with the project.
A base snap is a special kind of snap that provides a run-time environment
alongside a minimal set of libraries that are common to most applications.

```yaml
base: core20
```

In this example, [core20](https://snapcraft.io/core20) is used as the base for snap building, and is based
on [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). See [Base snaps](/t/11198) for more details.

### Security model

Snaps are containerised to ensure more predictable application behaviour and
greater security. The general level of access a snap has to the user's system
depends on its level of confinement.

The next section of the `snapcraft.yaml` file describes the level of
:term:`confinement` applied to the running application:

```yaml
confinement: devmode
```

It is best to start creating a snap with a confinement level that provides
warnings for confinement issues instead of strictly applying confinement.
This is done by specifying the `devmode` (developer mode) confinement value.
When a snap is in devmode, runtime confinement violations will be allowed but
reported. These can be reviewed by running `journalctl -xe`.

Because devmode is only intended for development, snaps must be set to strict
confinement before they can be published as "stable" in the Snap Store.
Once an application is working well in devmode, you can review confinement
violations, add appropriate interfaces, and switch to strict confinement.

The above example will also work if you change the confinement from `devmode`
to `strict`, as you would before a release.

### Parts

Parts define what sources are needed to build your application. Parts can be
anything: programs, libraries, or other needed assets, but for this example,
we only need to use one part for the *woke* source code:

```yaml
parts:
  woke:
    plugin: go
    source-type: git
    source: https://github.com/get-woke/woke
```

The `plugin` keyword is used to select a language or technology-specific
plugin that knows how to perform the build steps for the project.
In this example, the [go plugin](/t/7818) is used to
automate the build of this project using the version of Go on the host system.

The `source` keyword points to the source code of the project, which
can be a local directory or remote Git repository. In this case, it refers to
the main project repository.

### Apps

Apps are the commands and services that the snap provides to users. Each key
under `apps` is the name of a command or service that should be made
available on users' systems.

```yaml
apps:
  woke:
    command: bin/woke
    plugs:
      - home
```

The `command` specifies the path to the binary to be run. This is resolved
relative to the root of the snap contents.

If the command name matches the name of the snap specified in the top-level
`name` keyword (see **Metadata** above), the binary file will be given the
same name as the snap, as in this example.
If the names differ, the binary file name will be prefixed with the snap name
to avoid naming conflicts between installed snaps. An example of this would be
`woke.some-command`.

The confinement of the snap, which was defined in the **Security model** section
above, can be changed through a set of :term:`interfaces`. In this example,
the `plugs` keyword is used to specify the interfaces that the snap needs
to access.

### Building the snap

You can download the example repository with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/degville/woke-snap
```

After you have created the `snapcraft.yaml` file (which already exists
in the above repository), you can build the snap by simply executing the
`snapcraft` command in the project directory:

```bash
$ snapcraft
Launching a container.

```

The resulting snap can be installed locally. This requires the `--dangerous` flag because the snap is not signed by the Snap Store. The `--devmode` flag acknowledges that you are installing an unconfined application:

```bash
$ sudo snap install woke_*.snap --devmode --dangerous
```

You can then try it out:

```bash
$ woke -h
```

Removing the snap is simple too:

```bash
$ sudo snap remove woke
```

## Publishing your snap

To share your snaps you need to publish them in the Snap Store. First, create an account on [the dashboard](https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/dev/account/). Here you can customise how your snaps are presented, review your uploads and control publishing.

You’ll need to choose a unique “developer namespace” as part of the account creation process. This name will be visible by users and associated with your published snaps.

Make sure the `snapcraft` command is authenticated using the email address attached to your Snap Store account:

```
$ snapcraft login
```
